<p style="line-height:30px;width:70vw;text-align:left;"> The online world, like the majority of western culture, is very
ocular-centric. By prioritizing visual information, we miss out on our four other
senses and limit the experience of our users. In the earlier days of the
internet, vision was the only sense that could be used to interact with the
online world. However as technology advances we are constantly being shown new
ways of taking part of this experience. Sound, kinesthetics, voice, time, and
emotion are all areas that can now be tapped into through the web. By addressing
a multitude of senses through the web, we create more accessible and engaging
experiences for the user which will in turn foster emotional connections and
capture their interest.<br>&emsp;&emsp; For my final website, I was interested in addressing
this issue from an angle not typically explored online: discomfort. Since the
internet is a relatively safe environment where you can not cause physical
damage very easily, it provides an opportunity for carrying out certain
interactions without consequences. The website I created, Smush, takes the user
through a sequence of unrelated interactions that cause some degree of
discomfort or that we are not normally supposed to do. Written prompts on each
page explain to the user how they must complete each task in order to move
forwards. These prompts create pressure on the user to do strange things using
manipulative and sometimes dark language and humor to convince them to do so.
Although the user is unaware of what will come up next after each task is
completed and have no idea what will happen at the end, the game aspect of the
website keeps them engaged and motivated to carry on.<br>&emsp;&emsp; The website starts out
fairly benign, asking the user to simply drag a teddy bear out of its comfort
zone. Gradually as the user navigates through the site by completing tasks they
are made to feel uncomfortable with more visceral tasks.A page with pimples on
it requires the user to click and hold for a prolonged period of time in order
to pop each individual zit before being able to move forward. These time-based
interactions create a sense of urgency and labour that truly adds to the overall
experience as the user carries through the game. The final task of yelling at
yourself in the mirror takes the user through a more personal experience,
involving a multitude of senses.<br>&emsp;&emsp; I believe that my website was able to create an
environment where the user feels external pressure in a way that is not often
felt online. This was accomplished through the integration of sensorial
interactivity, persuasive text, humor, and attractive imagery. I think that the
strange pairing of desirable aesthetics with uncomfortable interactions is a big
factor in what attracts and holds the attention of the user. This website
counters the typical nature of the web in a way that many commercial sites do
not or cannot do. If we want to keep our users interested, stepping outside of
the strict boundaries of the conventional and conservative is a good start.
Smush is an extreme example but it gives us insight into elements of web design
and code that could be integrated into more mainstream areas of website and app
design. </p>
