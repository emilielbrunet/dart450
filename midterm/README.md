Emilie Brunet's midterm for DART 450 in Winter 2018

<h1> My Midterm Project </h1>
<h2> By Ã‰milie Brunet </h2>

<p> For my midterm assignment I created a multi-page website with the intention of making a space to play and create online. This playful interactive interface allows for the site's visitors to choose the way in which they decide to participate with the online activities, by either following the prompts or in some cases by getting creative with the provided materials. Scrap Paper is an exploration of how the Internet can be a playful space and in being this way, comments on the conservative, linear nature of the web. This is also a reflection of my online persona, as I believe that we should always have fun with the Internet, because it can too easily control us if we let it.</p>
